# **1\.   Project Approach**

The **FunFlip Game Project** was developed using a structured, iterative approach, integrating best practices from software engineering disciplines (as outlined in lectures and applied in practice):

1. **Requirements Engineering**  
   * Defined clear vision, SMART goals, personas, and user stories to align the product with educational objectives.  
   * Documented functional (e.g., card flipping logic, category and level selection) and non-functional requirements (e.g., ≤0.5s response time, offline operation).  
2. **System Architecture & Design**  
   * Applied a strict 5-layer architecture (UI, SceneLoader, Game Logic, Data, Services) for modularity, low coupling, and high cohesion.  
   * Prioritized usability, accessibility, and performance in design decisions, supported by diagrams (e.g., domain model, activity diagrams).  
3. **Implementation**  
   * Developed using the Godot Engine with reusable components (e.g., Card.tscn, AudioControl.gd) and data-driven design (e.g., categories.json).  
   * Applied agile-inspired iterations focusing on completing functional increments (e.g., category selection, card matching).  
4. **Quality Assurance & Testing**  
   * Created detailed test specifications and protocols covering functional and non-functional requirements.  
   * Performed system, integration, and acceptance tests on target platforms (Android/iOS) under realistic conditions.  
   * Executed both positive and negative test cases; no critical defects remained at acceptance.

 

 

 

5. **Documentation & Handover**  
   * Produced comprehensive documentation, including user manuals, architecture descriptions, and acceptance reports.  
   * Validated system usability and accessibility for the target audience (children aged 4–6).  
6. **Process Alignment**  
   * Reflected a tailored V-Model/W-Model process with early QA integration and parallel preparation of test activities.  
   * Aligned with software engineering standards from lecture guidelines (e.g., requirements traceability, design principles, validation focus).

   # **2\.   Lessons Learned**

Through this project, the team gained significant insights into software engineering practices:

1. **Importance of Early and Clear Requirements**  
   * Investing time in detailed requirements (functional and non-functional) reduced ambiguity during design and coding phases.  
2. **Value of Modular Architecture**  
   * A strict layered approach and component reuse (e.g., Card.tscn) simplified future updates and ensured maintainability.  
3. **Iterative Testing Prevents Late Surprises**  
   * Systematic, phased testing (unit → integration → system → acceptance) allowed early detection and resolution of issues.  
4. **User-Centered Design is Crucial**  
   * Designing for the end-user (young children) required thoughtful consideration of usability and accessibility, beyond basic functional correctness.  
5. **Documentation is Not Just a Deliverable**  
   * Keeping documentation up to date alongside development (architecture, requirements, testing) saved time and improved handover quality.

 

6. **Team Communication and Coordination**  
   * Clear communication and role separation (design, coding, testing) were vital for staying aligned and efficient.  
7. **Tool and Process Familiarity**  
   * Mastering tools (e.g., Godot, draw.io) and following structured processes (e.g., V-Model principles) significantly contributed to project success.
